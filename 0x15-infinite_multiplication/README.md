Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:

- Usage: **mul** **num1** **num2**
- **num1** and **num2** will be passed in base 10
- Print the result, followed by a new line
- If the number of arguments is incorrect, print **Error**, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of **98**
- **num1** and **num2** should only be composed of digits. If not, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of **98**
- You are allowed to use more than 5 functions in your file

```c
$ cc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-mul.c _putchar.c -o mul
$ ./mul 10 98
980
$
